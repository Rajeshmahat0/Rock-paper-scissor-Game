ðŸ§© What I Learned:
Function Definitions: Implemented the check function to determine the game outcome.
Conditional Logic: Used if-else statements to compare choices and declare the winner.
Random Number Generation: Employed random.randint to simulate the computerâ€™s choice.
ðŸ§  Next Steps:
Adding more features like score tracking.
Enhancing the user interface for a better experience.
Exploring advanced algorithms for game strategies.
I hope you find this simple game interesting! ðŸ˜Š Feel free to try it out and share your thoughts or improvements.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
